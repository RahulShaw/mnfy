mnfy - Minifier/obfuscator for Python 3
///////////////////////////////////////

The mnfy project provides a module which attempts to syntactically minimize
Python source code while continuing to be semantically identical. Optional
transformations are also provided which semantically transform the code in
various ways that lead to less source code. The levels of transformation are:

    * no transforms
        Purely syntactic minification (e.g., removing unneeded whitespace); the
        original AST representation of code does not change pre- or post-change
    * safe transforms
        Semantically equivalent, but the AST is allowed to change; equivalent
        to running Python with ``-OO``
    * functions to lambda expressions
        Translates qualifying functions to lambda expressions; unsafe as lambda
        expressions differ from functions (e.g., lack a ``__name__`` attribute)

To use mnfy from the command-line, use Python's ``-m`` flag::

    python3 -m mnfy -h
